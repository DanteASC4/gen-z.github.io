	<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
	<p>Gen Z was founded upon the idea of giving teens like us a place to talk about what they think, and their opinion on the world today. Although social media is giving teens a greater voice, many adults still shun teens from speaking out about what's going on, saying that we're not "educated enough". Additionally, there aren't many news sites or media outlets tailored specifically towards teens. Our site is built by Generation Z, for Generation Z. It's a place where we can share our opinions and voice openly, without anyone censoring or shunning us. We are here, and we're doing soemthing about it. We are Gen Z.</p>
