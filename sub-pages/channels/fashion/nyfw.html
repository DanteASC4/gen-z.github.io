	<h1> “Why is the shirt so special?" "Because it’s Supreme.”</h1>
	<h2>Ryan Biswas</h2>
		<p>Last Sunday, around 8 in the morning, the massive following cult that Men’s skate-clothing label has amassed throughout the two decades since its opening, flocked the website to catch a glimpse of the 2016 Fall Winter Season Lookbook. One of the most iconic brands in the streetwear world, Supreme has been notorious for their box logo design as well as their collaborations with other high-profile brands and celebrities. Not to mention the expanding number of online resellers who rush to buy the limited inventory and list them online for double or triple the price of retail. They have built such an iconic name for themselves that they can sell bricks that have their brand name engraved in them.</p>
		<p>So what makes streetwear and skating brands like Supreme so desirable? The answer lies in the community, appeal, and material. The appeal and material that is used in the clothing, is a major factor and is the first thought for most, looking into a clothing brand. Using Supreme as an example, they produce creative designs and do not hesitate to use quality material which can range from lambswool to rayon to cashmere. The community is filled with one that represents the majority in urban areas such as New York City or Los Angeles. I believe that with any brand when something starts being associated heavily with money, it becomes more attractive to someone. For example if there is a hooded sweatshirt retailing for $450 you will become more attracted to it because the sweatshirt is associated with money and represents how wealthy you are, whether it is a truthful or false representation. This “competition” of a higher wealth status sometimes drives people to purchase these expensive brands. Supreme is only one of the hundreds of brands that have helped shape the face of streetwear over the last couple decades.</p>
		<p>The world of streetwear is constantly changing with the introduction of new trends. However, in order for one to find the roots of streetwear or street fashion, one must understand the role hip-hop played in culture back in the 80’s and 90’s, when rapper groups like the Wu Tang Clan started wearing clothing brands on the come up like Nike and Champion. These endorsements laid down the foundation of street fashion, and was succeeded by artists and trendsetters such as Soulja Boy who wore absurdly large shirts and introduced the “baggy” look. Nevertheless, this trend subsided and was followed by a movement for more tighter and luxurious clothes supported by high profile artists such as A$AP Rocky. Whether it is Kanye West or the Wu Tang Clan, the world of street fashion has been ever-changing and will continue to change.</p>
