	<h1> Supreme </h1>
		<p>	The 20th anniversary of Kids, the movie has caused a nostalgic uproar in the hype-beast scene. For those who don’t know Kids is a movie portraying the lives of NYC teens in the 90’s and it explicitly emphasizes the dangers of sex and drugs with in the youth. The fashion in the movie is what has hypebeast going crazy. It features clothing lines such as Supreme, Independant and Comme des Garçons before they were big with a side of skate clips from the underground NYC skate scene. </p>
		<p>Many people joke about how cheap supreme used to be when it first began and now the demand for supreme is so high that people can make a living just off of reselling supreme clothing.Supreme is such a nostalgic brand that they drop a whole supreme x kids collab. It seems like the brand never loses touch with its roots, always putting down new skate videos and paying it forward. The hype for supreme only seems to be getting bigger. 
		</p>
		<p>	Supreme is becoming more mainstream while at the same time staying extremely underground. Confusingly enough, this is the one and only brand that was able to successfully do this. It makes Supreme a very special brand in the eyes of the world and especially in it’s home NYC.
		</p>
		<p>	How do you feel about supreme?</p>
