		<p>	Pop music is a genre that has dominated music charts for many years. This type of music had branched off from Rock and Roll during the 1950s and 60s. As the genre of music developed it has borrowed characteristics and styles from many different areas of music such as dance, rock, and country. In all pop songs it follows a structure of verse chorus and normally have a catchy melody and tune. </p>
		<p>	Current pop music includes a variety of different songs and artists who have different sounds and come from different races and backgrounds. For example one of the most popular songs is "This Is What You Came For" by Rihanna. Another popular song is "Send My Love" by Adele. These two songs have widely different sounds which sets them apart. In pop music there is room for people to become creative and make a little niche for their own sounds. This is different from many other genres because songs will not become repetitive because there are a variety of combinations in order to make a song. </p>
		<p>	As the genre developed there have been many people that have criticized this type of music. For example, some people believe that the quality of pop music had decreased. Many critics believe that the creativity of bands and artists were being stifled in order to make money. Also, the use of auto tune is a another aspect of pop music that many people criticize, because it leads people to believe that the music is highly manufactured and impersonal. Furthermore in more recent times many critics feel that current pop music has no value because of its explicit nature, which causes many people to write it off and will not listen to it. Regardless of what critics think, pop music is still the genre with singers with the most recognizable names and songs to the genre public; and will probably stay that way for a long time.</p>
