	<h1> Inspiration of Modernity </h1>
	<h2>Paula Glab</h2>
		<p>	Art has been a staple piece to human life for as long as there have been humans. It is a key factor in documenting life, and the ever changing aspects of it. However, much like the Human race itself, art is constantly changing, evolving, in order to accurately the represent ever changing cultures of our societies.</p>
		<p>	Taking a look back to some of the most renowned artists this world has come to know, such as Michelangelo or Grant Wood, one will find a vast difference in the art pieces they produced. This of course, has to do with the time period they were created in and the lives the artists themselves were living. For example, many of Michelangelo's pieces were derived from his work with the Catholic Church and are great symbols of his time. Many of Grant Wood's piece depict American farm life.</p>
		<p>Much like Michelangelo and Wood, there are artists in the 21st century that are creating 'modern' pieces that will one day come to represent our generations. Whether these pieces come to resemble age old art or take a completely different form on their own, there is no denying that years in the future, people will view them and get a glimpse into what life was like in the 21st century.</p>
