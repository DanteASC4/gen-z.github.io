	<h1> Olympic Skateboarding </h1>
    <h2>Author: Joey Cabrera </h2>
		<p>	The year is 2020 and the Tokyo Olympics are on, this time with a whole new sport. Yes, skateboarding is finally being added onto the long list of sports competing in the Olympics. It will make its first display in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as it has been recently voted in as an Olympic event. This, however, has caused a lot of controversy in the skate community. Some skaters say skateboarding is an art and a lifestyle not a sport and will only damage the culture that skateboarding has sprouted into. Other skaters say that the Olympics will bring good publicity towards skateboarding and we will stop being looked at as delinquents. So far, this has caused a skate civil war.</p>
		<p>	With skateboarding being in the Olympics , it is safe to say it is a sport. This will definitely increase the number of contest skaters in the skatepark trying the same lines for hours. There will be a bigger push with bigger companies such as adidas and nike, killing out the local skate companies. In addition , this also means that there will be government funding for skateboarding, that means more skateparks, and more respect towards the sport so it will definitely give a new vibe to the sport. It will no longer be viewed as this underground thing that rebel and delinquents do. The Olympics will give it a more athletic and jock vibe, people are already discussing skateboarding classes in school and highschool skate teams with coaches. People view this as good because it will bring a lot publicity to the sport and allow pro-skaters to get payed just like pro-basketball players. We are talking hundreds of millions. It was just recently that people could make a living off of skateboarding and the Olympics is only making that much more possible.</p>
		<p>	However, other skaters believe that this is a bad thing as the Olympics brings skateboarding into the light, other skaters will join not knowing the culture and it will dilute the culture. They are not for the big push with big companies taking over smaller companies that are more in touch with the culture and skate lifestyle. They fear contest skaters will rule over core skaters who put out street videos. They fear skateboarding is losing touch with its roots and becoming something else. They are afraid of the change. But what do you guys think? Am I leaving anything out? Did I forget any other effects the Olympics is having on the skate community? <p>
