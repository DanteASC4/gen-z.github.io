	<h1> Virtual Reality: The Future of Gaming </h1>
	<h2>Kevin Calderon</h2>
		<p>Virtual Reality has long been a field confined to smartphones and mobile gaming. HEadsets are designed specifically to phones and smaller devices due to the fact that they are inexpensive to create. Although there are alternatives that involve non mobile-based VR headsets, many are very expensive, which is why not a lot of people have been given exposure to such VR tech. However, this could all change soon after Microsoft unveiled a new type of gaming console that is based around Virtual Reality.</p>
		<p>Dubbed Project Scorpio by Microsoft, this project has a lot of promise for both VR fanatics as well as hardcore gamers. According to the company, it would be an inexpensive new type of gaming that would allow for more people to get exposure to non mobile VR experiences. It is also revolutionary in terms of graphics; it would be one of the first VR systems to offer video and gaming in 4K, which is the next level in graphics.</p>
		<p>Although Project Scorpio isn't expected to hit shelves until the holidays of 207, it is a very promising project that will expand VR into other fields of tech, not just  mobile gaming and smartphone usage. Many look forward to such advances, and some even say it might rival to traditional systems already being used, such as the Xbox and PS4.</p>
