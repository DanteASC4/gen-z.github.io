		<p>In the Hindu religion, mandalas can be found in small artistic pieces, or in large temples called mandirs. One form of this art is known as the yantra. The yantra contains a single deity while the latter can contain an infinite number. Hindus see mandalas as images of the universe. They consider the space within the circle a place that is free of negative spirits, more specifically, demons. They create mandalas with the purpose of seeking refuge from the evil forces.</p>
		<p>Tibet is known for its use of mandalas, as it is the home to many Buddhists. They see these circles in a way to helping them associate themselves with rebirth, while producing a harmonious and beautiful world. Tibetan mandalas follow certain rules. In order for it to capture the essence of Buddha’s completion, they must depict a rectangular image on a circular shape. This represents the a journey towards enlightenment, and this journey is often portrayed through movement into the core of the mandala.</p>
		<p>Lastly, a frequently seen example of a mandala is seen in the Christian religion. They are most often seen within the architecture of the churches, found in the Rosette windows. These windows are made from colored glass, produced by crushed gemstones. The rosette represents a map of the universe, as well as our mental and inner selves. The main colors used in these mandalas are red and blue, creating the sacred color, purple. They make these mandalas to represent the journey of finding and seeking God. Colors used represent spirituality and different feelings of worship and praise taking place during such a journey. In essence, the mandala is a form of art that derived from a variety of cultures. Whether they may be related or not, they all have their own unique interpretations and styles of creating such a figure. The beauty behind the mandala is whatever one’s eyes make of it.</p>
