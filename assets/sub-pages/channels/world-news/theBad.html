	<h1> Zika </h1>
	<h2>Sophia Castro</h2>
		<p> In the most recent months, Zika has sprung as outbreaks have been reported worldwide. However, Zika isn’t new news, as hundreds of cases had already been reported in warm tropical areas, primarily in South America. For those who aren’t familiar with the symptoms, Zika can cause pain behind someone’s eyes, joints and muscles. It can also cause fevers, tiredness, excessive sweating, chills, and vomiting. WHat makes Zika so lethal is it’s ability to cause microcephaly in newborns when infecting a pregnant host. THis is a mental and physical disability caused as a result of abnormal brain development. The transmission of Zika Is brought through by the daytime action of a mosquito family. It’s recently been discovered that Zika can be transmitted through sexual intercourse from one host to another. Even so, not a lot is known in regards to ZEke's transmission points, limits, abilities, long term effects, etc. Those most affected by the Zika epidemic include third world countries, which make research and any form of advancement that much difficult for researchers. Prevention methods are limited to simple prevention methods, due to the lack of knowledge and understanding of the disease and how it works. Although many citizens are informed about the virus and prevention methods through public service announcements and advertisements, unfortunately economic and social conditions in many of these countries make it virtually impossible to get the message out to everyone. Zika has affected millions of people worldwide, however, the dedication and new technology has pushed humankind closer to a solution to such an epidemic, as well as how to solve future epidemics.</p>
