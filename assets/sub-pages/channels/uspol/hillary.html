	<h1> Breaking the Glass Ceiling: What Hillary’s Campaign Really Means for the Future of the United States </h1>
	<h2>Leyla Arcasoy</h2>
		<p>	 On the penultimate day of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, several tears were shed as Democratic presidential hopeful, Hillary R. Clinton, made a short speech on the venue’s television screen.  Headed by the performance of a makeup-free Alicia Keys, and an animation of each male President, the glass screen was broken to the melodies of Keys’ hit single “Girl on Fire.”  Clinton donned the screen, and before she could even speak, the crowd erupted in cheers, tears, and chants for Hillary.  In her short speech thanking Philadelphia for the turnout, and expressing her excitement to speak on the final day of the convention, Clinton made one address to all of the young girls in the country who were eagerly watching to see the Presidential hopeful.  “And if there are any little girls out there who stayed up late to watch,” Clinton said, “Let me just say, I may become the first woman president, but one of you is next.”</p>
		<p>	This statement is the epitome of what Clinton’s hopeful election into the Presidency may really mean for the future of the United States, as well as the future of all of the young girls in the country.  If the politics of her campaign are stripped away and it is looked at in the eyes of the little girls of the country, too young to understand what politics are about, Clinton’s campaign is the culmination of the strife of American women throughout history.  To the little girls who watched Clinton speak at the Democratic Convention, they see a woman who is making her name, her voice, and her face known to the entire country.  These little girls finally have a role model who has managed to go the extra mile and succeed, no matter the harsh criticisms nor the societal stigmas.</p>
		<p>	Whether Clinton wins the election or not, just the very fact that she is the first woman to hold the title of Presidential Candidate is huge for the progress of women.  The little girls of America need to be able to have a strong, influential role model within the executive branch of government; they need to be able to know that they too, can be just as influential as Hillary Rodham Clinton, if not more.  The young girls of America need to know that they have every opportunity as the young boys of America to make the future of the United States great.</p>
		<p>For the young girls of the United States, the young girls that will eventually be the face of the country some time in the future, knowing that they have the ability and capacity to achieve something as great as the title of President of the United States is something immeasurable.  Clinton’s role in the race is groundbreaking, not just for the fact that history is being written, but because the future is being determined.</p>
