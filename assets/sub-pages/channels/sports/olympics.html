		<p>In the first few days of competition in the 2016 Rio Olympics there have been an intense amount of competition. While there were an electric energy surrounding the Olympics, there were a variety of issues also attached with it. For example, prior to the opening ceremony there were numerous terrorist threats from extremist groups vowing to kill in large numbers. This created a large number of fear amount the people of a variety of people. Additionally, the amount of poverty in this area of Brazil has a large affect on the attendance of the Olympics. Furthermore, the contamination of the water and poor conditions of the rooms for athletes were off putting to many people. Nevertheless these obstacles were overcome and the open ceremony took place.</p> 
		<p>The Rio Olympics' opening ceremony told the the story of the Brazilian people. It beautifully portrayed the spirit and lifestyle if the indigenous people. The ropes and strings that the dancers were holding created the intricacies of the different parts of the rain forest. The next story that was told was the story of the slave trade and industrialization. Large metal structures were brought out in order to display the change in lifestyle and many of the indigenous dancers wore chains. The next chapter was more recent to the current time; this displayed the spirit of the Brazilian people through current music and dancing styles. At the end of the opening ceremony there was a party like atmosphere that filled the arena which was fitting for the pride that each country had for their athletes. With the completion of the opening ceremony, the 2016 Rio Olympics began.</p>
		<p>Two athletes that have brought a large amount of attention to the games in their respective sports are Michael Phelps and Lilly King. While both of these athletes are swimmers, they faced very different challenges. In Michael Phelps' case he needed to do redeem himself in his own race. After loosing the 200 meter butterfly to South African swimmer, Chad le Clos during 2012 London Olympics, Phelps had a desire to place first in the race. There has been a fierce rivalry between these two swimmers which was clearly seen through Phelps' facial expressions and le Clos' actions in the Ready Room, which later became a meme. As both of these swimmers walked out to the blocks, Phelps was cheered on by his mother, fianc√©e, and 3 month old son Boomer. At the end of the race Michael Phelps regained his first place standing and a roaring applause from the crowd. In Lilly King's case she wanted to prove a point for many athletes. One of King's largest opponents was Russian swimmer, Yulia Efimova. Efimova and many other Russain athletes were under review for their use of doping in order to gain an unfair advantage in the games. The last minute decision to allow Yulia Efimova to compete in the Olympics caused her to declare herself as the #1 swimmer in the world. When the race came underway, Lily King beat Yulia Efimova. King after observing the times, raised her finger to show that Yulia Efimova was not the #1 swimmer in the world. In a variety of interviews, King stated that she wanted to prove that athletes who were cheating in the games were not going to win gold and undermine the hard work of the honest athletes.</p> 
		<p>These two events are just a small portion of the Olympic Games that mean so much to so many people. In the days to come there will be many more athletes who will bring honor and pride to their country and create an amazing Olympic game.</p>
