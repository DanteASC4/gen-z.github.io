	<h1>Lost Yet Found</h1>
	<h2>Briana Lalman</h2>
		<p>	It is often said that personal experiences greatly influence the mindset of an individual. As a young girl growing up in a positive environment with her older sister and wonderful parents, I was never truly exposed to the evils of the world. Every day I would go to school, see my friends, do homework, eat dinner, and repeat the process. In the news, I’d always see crimes taking place and I did know the world was a bad place, yet nothing ever personally affected me.<br>It was not until Monday, July 27th, 2015 that my interpretation of this world was changed forever. I was at Hofstra University with my sister, doing my summer homework for the new school year, while she was studying for her medical school exam. I got several missed calls from my grandfather’s best friend, but I didn’t answer because I always thought he was annoying. After I failed to respond, he called my sister who eventually picked up to discover that my grandfather, who lived in Guyana, went to collect some money that was owed to him at 9 a.m. and never returned home. At this point, it was already 7 p.m.<br>We thought the old man was crazy and was overthinking the situation. However, in the back of our minds, we knew something was up, yet we refused to believe it. We went straight home and told our parents, and they began making phone calls to everyone they knew in Guyana, the police stations, and the people who owed him money. By 11 p.m., when there was still no sign of him, it became a real nightmare. The police were uncooperative and would not search until morning, but what can you really expect from a third world justice system?<br>It was the worst week of my entire life. There were false leads, empty promises, and a corrupt system. Tears fell everyday as every night, we would have about thirty people in my house making calls and planning how we would find him. We posted our story on different platforms of social media, sent his picture to Guyanese news outlets, and even put out a reward to anyone that knew of his whereabouts.<br>On Thursday, July 30th, 2015, we were called by a family member in Guyana. “We found him…he’s dead.” By hearing “We found him” gave me a moment of utter happiness and relief, but the moment afterwards killed me. They found his body in a shallow grave, buried in the backyard of the man who owed him money. His body was covered with a layer of zinc. After autopsy reports, we found out he was hit and strangled by the intoxicated man.<br>I grew up in a home where tragedy had never hit before. After experiencing such a brutal and heartbreaking time, I now feel scared everyday to leave my home. At any moment, anything can happen and your world will be shattered. I live everyday now trying to do everything my grandfather would want me to do and to accomplish everything he should have been here to see. Whenever I see crime in the news now, I actually feel the pain because of the injustice we experienced. This motivated me to keep pursuing a deeper interest in the field of criminal justice and law. </p>
