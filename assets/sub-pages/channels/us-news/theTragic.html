	<h1> Louisiana Flooding </h1>
	<h2>Claudia Dana</h2>
		<p>As the summer ravages most areas with heat, parts of Louisiana are currently submerged under what has been called historic amounts of rain. The rainfall began on the 13th of August, and shows no sign of stopping over the coming week. Initially, central and southern Louisiana were the hardest hit, with three reported dead and over 7,000 rescued from their homes or vehicles as of August 14th. According to the Weather Channel, the flooding is expected to surpass the previous flood record by four and a half feet.</p>
		<p>Louisiana has had it’s share of hurricanes and flooding, yet Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards called this an  "unprecedented and historic flooding event." The National guard has been called in to assist with rescue efforts, which have involved  rescues "Not just from their homes but from their vehicles," said Edwards, and "some people, not just from their vehicles, they've been clinging to trees and other things like this in swift-moving floodwaters." A video of one such recuse from a Louisiana resident’s car has gone viral. In the video, a woman is pulled from her car, which is almost completely submerged under the floodwaters. Once she is pulled safely to a platform, she begins to plead with the rescuers to save her dog as well. Soon, a very wet, but very much so alive dog is reunited with it’s owner.</p>
		<p>Louisiana Transportation Secretary Shawn Wilson said authorities are preparing for more rain. "We are concerned and are monitoring the weather conditions as this element moves westward, and we've got folks deployed where we're using every barricade and every high-water sign there is to notice the public and prepare them," Wilson said.</p>
