	<h1> A New York Community In Shambles After Beloved Imam and Assistant Are Killed Near Mosque in Broad Daylight </h1>
	<h2>Leyla Arcasoy</h2>
		<p>	 The horrifying moment when a Queens Imam and his assistant are gunned down in broad daylight after leaving prayer is all captured on nearby surveillance video.  The grainy video shows a man approaching Imam Maulana Akonjee, 55, and Thara Uddin, 64, as they left Al-Furqan Jame Masjid Mosque in Queens.  The gunman shot the pair in the backs of the head before they fell to the ground. The gunman was seen running off on 79th street with gun still in hand, leaving the pair in the street to die.  When found at around 2 pm, both men were rushed to Jamaica hospital where Akonjee was pronounced dead.  Four hours later, Uddin was also pronounced dead.</p>
		<p>Despite there being no official determined motive, members of the Muslim community worry it could have been a hate crime.  Several residents have blamed the rise of Islamophobia for the severely tragic crime, and say that powerful figures such as Donald Trump should not go about the media creating drama and an inherent rise to Islamophobia.  There was one theory that the gunman had motives to rob the men as the Imam was carrying approximately $1,000 on him.  However, no money was stolen, and community members continue to insist that the deaths of two beloved men of the community was a result of hate and Islamophobia.</p>
		<p>	The Queens community is now left confused and scared as a result of the two deaths.  No one can understand how such a good, beloved man could have his life taken away from him so shortly and so cruelly.  Several others in the community have expressed fear to attend prayer because of the crime that plagued that community.</p>
