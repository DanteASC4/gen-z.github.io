	<h1> Third Party Options </h1>
	<h2>Claudia Dana</h2>
		<p>With many feeling unsatisfied with the Republican and Democratic nominees for President, an estimated 40% of voters under 30 are putting their votes towards Third Party candidates according to a recent McClatchy-Marist poll. Those who once supported political maverick Bernie Sanders are now torn four ways: Bernie or Bust, Jill Stein (Green Party), Donald Trump to stop Hillary, or Hillary to stop Trump. On the opposite side of the spectrum, unhappy Republican voters had no one candidate to unify under to stop Donald Trump, the current Republican nomination for the presidency, and are faced with the choice of voting for Hillary to stop Trump, Trump to stop Hillary, or Gary Johnson (Libertarian).</p>
		<p>Johnson campaigned for the presidency in 2012 on the Libertarian ballot as well, and has served as the governor of New Mexico. His platform involves a simplification of taxes as well as military non-interventionism. According to The Hill, during his governorship he lowered taxes 14 times but never raised them. Moreover, in an interview with Politico he stated that while critical of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he does support it. Johnson has been described as fiscally conservative yet socially liberal, and believes in a woman’s right to choose, marriage equality, and the legalization of marijuana. While Libertarians often appealed to disillusioned conservatives, in this election cycle Johnson is also actively attempting to appeal to the anti-Clinton left.</p>
		<p>Dr. Jill Stein is a Harvard educated physician, political activist, and environmentalist. Similarly to her Libertarian counterpart, she was also her party’s nominee during the 2012 election cycle. Often referencing FDR’s New Deal, she advocates for a “Green New Deal” which would focus on a shift to clean, safe renewable energy as well as creating federal projects that would allow every person who is capable of work a job. According to her official platform, she wishes to “democratize the Federal Reserve” and cancel all student debt with something known as “quantitative easing.” Quantitative easing is, according to Stein, “a magic trick that basically people don't need to understand any more about than that it is a magic trick.” which “our mis-leaders saw fit to do for Wall Street when they bailed them out to the tune of 16 or 17 trillion dollars using so called quantitative easing.” As expected, Stein is very liberal on all social issues, and also supports a woman’s right to choose, marriage equality, and the legalization of marijuana. In an election where so many feel unrepresented, it is crucial that all options are seriously explored.</p>
