	<h1> History of Rap </h1>
	<h2>Jevaun McLean</h2>
		<p>Rap is very controversial it can bring many people together and it can tear them apart. It has become essential to African American progression in society. It has become a part of a culture and a revolution. Although it is very fun to listen to it can also be very dangerous. For example people can misinterpret the message behind the Migos, Young Thug and many incoming rappers.</p>
		<p>It is often spoken about that rape can spark violence especially when listening to the music closely. Back in the 1980’s even the government felt as if rap was extremely dangerous because of the NWA’s proclamations in their lyrics. In the era we live in police brutality have become prevalent for some reason. Especially now with social media it has gotten exposed all over dating back to the days of NWA to the present day Black Lives Matter movement. Rap has been debated on as controversial to listen to especially for the youth of America. Rap lyrics contain aspects of Drugs, Gun violence, explicit language and sense of discontent towards the police.</p>
		<p>Rap is essential to African American culture but sometimes it can hinder its progression. Artists like Drake, Jay Z and Nas can bring a stop to the violence their mainstream popularity can bring gangs together and kill the discontent towards the police. We live in 2016 and their needs to be an end to all the influential violence. There's said to be a strong connection between cultural evocation and violence when it comes to African Americans and Rap. There's no way that's true and it needs to be disproved.</p>
