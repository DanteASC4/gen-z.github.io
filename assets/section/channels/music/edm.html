	<h1> History of EDM </h1>
	<h2>Briana Lalman</h2>
		<p>Electronic dance music, also known as EDM, is one of the most dominant musical genres in the industry today. This genre consists of a variety of styles, which have evolved for more than half a century. Many believe that with the emergence of new technology in the 21st century came the birth of EDM. However, this had been developing since the 1970s.</p>
		<p>When a person thinks of the ‘70s and ‘80s, one would most likely imagine the era of disco and rock. Yet, this was also the time in which dance music began to make its entrance. EDM originated from the popular sounds of these decades, as bands began to use new instruments to intensify and differentiate their music. For example, the Beatles experimented with keyboards to be unique. Also, at the time, with technological developments, movie makers also used new accents which have been fused with popular music.</p>
		<p>Later on, new bands such as Kraftwerk, Deep Purple, and more, would bring EDM from being a part of other genres to being its own individual genre. People were more and more interested in the new melodies produced by these bands and craved more. It was at this point that EDM had built its roots in the music industry. Hard rock bands adopted this change in sound, and used it to make their music more desirable. By the 1990s, EDM had ranged in different branches from house music to techno music. Not only was it prominent in the United States, but it grew fame in countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany as well.</p>
		<p>Today’s most popular EDM figures include Diplo, Calvin Harris, David Guetta, Avicii, Zedd, Martin Garrix, and more. Their music has gained popularity worldwide, as it would be played on the radio, in parties, clubs, raves, etc. EDM has grown to become a mainstream phenomenon, as more artists of other genres began to incorporate aspects of it in their work. Famous artists from Justin Bieber to Kanye West have collaborated with makers of EDM to uplift a modern sound to our world. Although dance music has become a major part of our Billboard hits, there are thousands of EDM artists focusing their work on smaller audiences and have yet to be discovered.</p>
