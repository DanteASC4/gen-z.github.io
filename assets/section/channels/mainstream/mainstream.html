	<h1>Berenstain, Berenstein: The Mandela Effect and What it Means</h1>
	<h2>Leyla Arcasoy</h2>
		<p>	You might have seen some murmuring and whispers about the beloved children’s characters, “The Berenstain Bears”, and upon seeing the “a” in “Berenstain,” taken a step back and gasped aloud.  “That’s not how it’s spelled” you might even say to yourself, “It’s ‘Berenstein’ not ‘Berenstain.’”  “Maybe it was changed,” you might have asked yourself.  But it wasn’t- there isn’t a single reported instance in history where the names of the characters have been changed.  If you are one of those people who, like myself, were shocked that “The Berenstain Bears” exist, and not “The Berenstein Bears” you might come from a parallel universe where the characters are called “The Berenstein Bears.”  This phenomenon of mass misremembering is called the Mandela Effect.</p>
		<p>The Mandela Effect originates from an instance wherein a woman named Fiona Broome specifically remembered the death of Nelson Mandela in the 1980s, but then finding out he was still alive.  A very shaken Broome took it upon herself to ask her peers and several others about it to make sure she was sane and found out that there was a large number of people who distinctly remember Mandela’s death in the 80’s, and not in 2013.</p>
		<p>	There are a couple of different theories to explain the phenomenon that includes the memories of thousands of people.  One theory brings up parallel universes in which there is one parallel universe where the bears are called the Berensteins and another where the bears are called the Berenstains.  Another theory is that somehow, someone was able to go back in time and alter the past ever so slightly to inadvertently change the death of Mandela and the spelling of the bears’ names.  One final idea that was brought up in an interview with Vice, expert of false memories, Dr. Henry L. Roediger says that people most likely remembers the Berenstein Bears with “ein” instead of “ain” because that is a more common way to spell the surname (i.e. Einstein, Frankenstein, Goldstein, etc.)</p>
		<p>	As to which theory seems most truthful or most verifiable, I cannot say nor am I in any position to say.  But I must admit I was quite mind-blown when reading the Reddit threads and other sources about the occurrence.  There are some other lesser known examples of the Mandela Effect.  For example, there are some discrepancies over the number of states, 50 or 51; the famous Star Wars line, “Luke, I am your father” vs. “No, I am your father”; or even Froot Loops vs. Fruit Loops.</p>
