	<h1> Going For the Gold: How the Rio Olympics Have Brought the World Together</h1>
	<h2>Leyla Arcasoy</h2>
		<p>A very magical thing happens when the world comes together in lieu of the very best athletes on Earth.  Surrounded by the lights, costumes, and sounds of samba in Carnaval-style Rio, the Summer Olympics provide an exciting reason for all of the world to come together for 16 action-packed days.  In spite of the several misfortunes and disasters that plague the world today, the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics have provided cause to bring the world together.</p>
		<p>Perhaps this occurs because no country views the other as enemies, but as competitors.  There is no such thing as politics or policies, or even the defense of beliefs and traditions.  Instead, every country is on a level playing field, playing by the same rules and focusing only on medaling.  For each country, as well as each individual athlete, there is a sense of security and peace in these 16 short days.  No one person or country is at risk with one another, and there is opportunity to temporarily throw away national disputes and learn about several other cultures.</p>
		<p>Even when the Olympics were held in ancient Greece from 770 BC, one of the official rules of the Games was that all war was prohibited during the Games as well as the times preceding and following.  This was to ensure that all spectators and athletes traveling to the events could safely get to the Olympics without dangerous situations.<p>
		<p>In a modern world, where national dissent and controversy is exponentially more common, the Olympic Games have an astounding effect to quiet the arguments between metaphorically warring nations and bring reason for those countries to support their athletes and each other.  There are 1,445 other days in the four-year span between each Olympics for global leaders to continue to deal with several other pressing matters, but in these 16 days, there is a sense of peace and security and an opportunity to compete with the best athletes in the world.</p>
