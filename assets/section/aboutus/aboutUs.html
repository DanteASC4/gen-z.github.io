	<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
	<p>Gen Z was founded upon the idea of giving teens like us a place to talk about what they think, and their opinion on the world today. Although social media is giving teens a greater voice, many adults still shun teens from speaking out about what's going on, saying that we're not "educated enough". Additionally, there aren't many news sites or media outlets tailored specifically towards teens. Our site is built by Generation Z, for Generation Z. It's a place where we can share our opinions and voice openly, without anyone censoring or shunning us. We are here, and we're doing something about it. We are Gen Z.</p>

		<p id="writertextFO">My name is Kevin, and I'm a junior at the Scholar's Academy. I'm a go with the flow kind of guy, who's always down to meeting new people and getting to know others well. I really enjoy talking to people and enjoy having the company of others. I'm very into volunteer work, and just making the world into a better place. My music tatses can range from EDM, to Rock, to Soca. I enjoy art a lot, and find creating it just as great. I wanted to create this site to give teens a place dedicated to voicing their opinions. I'm a hardcore liberal, and I enjoy chocoloate chip cookies.</p>

		<p id="writertext">My name is Alexis Strawn and I live in Warner Robins, Georgia, about 2 hours south of Atlanta. I’ve lived in Georgia my whole life and am hoping to be able to go to college somewhere where it’s not so unbearably humid all the time! My hobbies include playing the saxophone in my high school’s concert and marching band, teaching myself clarinet and guitar, creative writing, Netflix, hanging out with friends, stressing over school, and sleeping. I also enjoy discussing politics, cooking and baking when I find the time, and volunteering with a domestic violence prevention program. I’m very excited to be able to write for Gen Z and hope you all enjoy my work!</p>
